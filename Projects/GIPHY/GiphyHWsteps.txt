They are sitting on / get attached to the global object

AT. Global level "this" is equal to the global object (WINDOW).

Outter environment is null at global level.

***************************


Page should start with several buttons in header area.
Use Bootstrap for styling

Have one input field, make sure to wrap in form tag.
Include submit button and give everything an ID.

PUT EVENT listener on button, and store everything as a variable. Pass that variable into your makeCall function which will hold the AJAX call. The variable will be plugged into
A concatenated URL. Also put a variable or placeholder for API key?

Look into Gitignore files for storing the API key. Possibly make a variable for the API key that references the file in GITIGNORE. Put the variable
Into the concatenated URL for the AJAX call 

Promise.then 
Or onreturn...  What to do with JSON object...use stringify? The information needs to be stored for the on click event.

Access necessary parts of JSON obj using dot notation. Remember it will be an array of GIPHY objects. Possibly store certain parts as variables.

Use innerHTML or document.write to change content of page. This should remove any old contents and only include the new content that comes after..

Use a for loop to access the array of objects and they same key/value pairs for each object. 
Append to page or document.write to page.


Reference the class activity on button creation and the YouTube video from LearnWebCode on AJAX and JSON.
