When the values are put into Firebase DB, they keep replacing each other....why?
	Is that OK or need to be fixed.



WHATS THE DIFFERENCE:

database.ref().on("value", function (snapshot) {
	let name = (snapshot.val().train)

AND

database.ref().on("child_added", function (childSnapshot) {
    console.log(childSnapshot.val());
 
	var empName = childSnapshot.val().name;
    	var empRole = childSnapshot.val().role;


Maybe explain some of the employee timesheet code?

Why is JS for creating new text rows running ONLOAD?
